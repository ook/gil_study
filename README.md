# GIL Study

Context: during a job interview, I wasn't able to talk about ruby GIL. So this repository is some kind of practice to understand GIL and the different Ruby solutions to bypass it.

## Documentation

Relevant links:

* https://workingwithruby.com/wwrt/gil/
* https://tihandev.com/concurrency-vs-parallelism-and-gil/

## Planned items

I'll check my knowledge about:

* Thread (rather confident in this one)
* Fiber
* Ractor (need to dig into it)

I'll need to benchmark execution speed and memory footprint
